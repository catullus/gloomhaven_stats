The game seems to be well balanced, how could the design come up so short when it comes to the utility of other augment cards?\n    2. There must be certain sitations where augments other than TMW are \"more optimal\" to deploy\n* For this very simple simulation, **\"more optimal\" means 'the augment card that leads to more damage in a single round of combat'**. \n* __We do not consider possible damage mitigation from Withering Claw's \"muddle\" effect__, which is an important \"defensive\" feature of Withering Claw\n\n### Graph Interpretation \n\n* The following graphs are a histogram of the simulation results\n* Each simulation is a round of combat with 0 - 3 allies present (that aid in damage dealt to a single creature)\n* The x-axis is thus total damage dealt by the Mindthief + Party\n* The red line is a visual reference point for the mean damage output for a type of simulation \n    * The numeric value of the red line is also shown in the plot's title\n\n```{r warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}\n## mindthief_sims\nmindthief_attack_deck = c(2,3,1,3,1,2,1,1)\n## \nbase_modifier_deck <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0, 1,1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1, 2, -2, \"2x\", \"miss\")\n\n## 2. set augment\nmt_augments <- list(minds_weakness = list(attack = 2, debuff = \"\", buff = \"\"), \n                    withering_claw = list(attack = 0, debuff = \"poison, muddle\", buff = \"\"),\n                    feedback_loop = list(attack = 0, debuff = \"\", buff = \"+1 shield\"))\n\n\nsource(\"function_mindthief.R\")\n\nminds_weakness_sim1 = replicate(1000, expr = sim_mindthief(modifier_deck = base_modifier_deck, attack_deck = mindthief_attack_deck, augment = mt_augments[[1]], ally = 1))\n\nminds_weakness_sim0 = replicate(1000, expr = sim_mindthief(modifier_deck = base_modifier_deck, attack_deck = mindthief_attack_deck, augment = mt_augments[[1]], ally = 0))\n\nwithering_claw_sim1 = replicate(1000, expr = sim_mindthief(modifier_deck = base_modifier_deck, attack_deck = mindthief_attack_deck, augment = mt_augments[[2]], ally = 1))\n\nwithering_claw_sim0 = replicate(1000, expr = sim_mindthief(modifier_deck = base_modifier_deck, attack_deck = mindthief_attack_deck, augment = mt_augments[[2]], ally = 0))\n\nminds_weakness_sim2 = replicate(1000, expr = sim_mindthief(modifier_deck = base_modifier_deck, attack_deck = mindthief_attack_deck, augment = mt_augments[[1]], ally = 2))\n\nwithering_claw_sim2 = replicate(1000, expr = sim_mindthief(modifier_deck = base_modifier_deck, attack_deck = mindthief_attack_deck, augment = mt_augments[[2]], ally = 2))\n\nwithering_claw_sim3 = replicate(1000, expr = sim_mindthief(modifier_deck = base_modifier_deck, attack_deck = mindthief_attack_deck, augment = mt_augments[[2]], ally = 3))\n\nminds_weakness_sim3 = replicate(1000, expr = sim_mindthief(modifier_deck = base_modifier_deck, attack_deck = mindthief_attack_deck, augment = mt_augments[[1]], ally = 3))\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\n\nmax_label = max(minds_weakness_sim1, minds_weakness_sim0, withering_claw_sim1, withering_claw_sim0, withering_claw_sim2, minds_weakness_sim2)\n\nhist(minds_weakness_sim3, main = paste(\"TMW, allies = 3;\",mean(minds_weakness_sim3)), xlim = c(0, max_label));
